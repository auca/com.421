Text Editor
===========

User Story:

As a user of the text editor, I would like
to be able to edit text without distractions.
I don't want to see any unnecessary UI. I
don't want to see menus, or any buttons. I
would like to only see the area where I
can edit the text to focus on my work. The
application must start in the center of the
screen as I don't like to reposition it
every time it starts. The application must
be maximized on every start to cover all the
other distractions on the OS. The application
should be named Focus. The program should
only be able to open and save files, but the
program should not have any buttons or menues
to do that.
