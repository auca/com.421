# COM 421, Software Engineering
### Practice Task #8, Microservices

#### Task Requirements

If possible and applicable try to move from the monolith architecture to the
microservice one or at least to a hybrid system [optional].

If not applicable, you have to create a solid argumentation and explain to the
professor that containers are not appropriate in your scenario. Your argument or
arguments must be substantial and backed by specific examples in your system.
Failure to provide a solid case will result in grade 0. Because of that be
careful going with this option.

Extra points will be given if you succeed in adapting a container orchestration
system such as Docker Swarm, K8s, or Mesosphere.

#### Recommended Systems

* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)
