#### Task Requirements

Ensure that work on your senior diploma project by using a software development
methodology and by utilizing an ALM system.

The ALM system selection is up to you. You may use Jira, GitLab, GitHub (with
Projects and Activities, or third party integrations such as Trello and Travis),
or any other system.

#### Working With Customer's Requirements

1. Create a new project in the selected ALM.
2. Setup the version control system.
3. Keep track of requirements and tasks.
4. Ensure tracability between them and the VCS.
5. Use storyboarding.
6. Utilize time and task estimation techniques.

#### Testing

1. Create a separate project for unit tests.
2. Consider using the Test-First approach in development.
3. Fake the UI interactions with system dialogs in your tests.
4. Maintain the code coverage by your tests at least at 70%.

#### Using Continuous Integration

1. Automate builds through a CI system.
2. Set it up to trigger a build and test steps for every commit to the
   development branch.

#### Managing Sources

1. Use local feature branches for every work item from the project.
2. Merge/rebase feature branches to the local development branch on task completion.
3. Push the development branch to the remote repository.
4. Merge/rebase to the stable master branch only through a pull request.
5. Configure the master branch policies to force at least one code review, a
   successful CI build, and a linked work item for every pull request.

#### Deadlines

You will have time untill the end of the semester.
