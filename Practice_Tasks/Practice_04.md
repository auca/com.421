# COM 421, Software Engineering
## Practice Task #4, Distributed Git Workflows (Integration-Manager)

### Requirements

1. Take a break from your own `vmath` repo on GitHub and go to the public `vmath` repo <https://github.com/rachmiroff/vmath>.

2. In that repo, go to the Projects page and find a suitable task for you to do.

3. Assign the task for yourself, move it into the 'In Progress' column of the Kanban-like board. If you don't have access to it, write to the instructor a email message with your GitHub login.

4. Fork the `rachmiroff`'s repo, then clone your forked repo to your computer.

5. Go to the `dev` branch, create an issue branch from it, switch to that issue branch.

6. Do the work on the task, making several commits.

7. Merge the work from the issue branch to `dev`.

8. Push the `dev` branch to your forked repo on GitHub.

9. Go to GitHub and create a Pull Request (PR) from `dev` of your forked repo to the `rachmiroff`'s dev of `vmath`.

10. Ensure the PR is accepted by pushing fixes requested by the reviewers.
